## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📋 For Students & Faculty

Visit the project board to:
- **Browse** available collaborative projects
- **Join** projects that match your interests
- **Propose** your own project ideas
- **Build** skills and gain project-based experience

## 🔧 For Admins

### Managing Projects

Projects are managed through Google Forms and Google Sheets:

1. Students/faculty submit proposals via the form
2. Review submissions in your Google Sheet
3. Add **"Approved"** in the Status column to publish projects
4. Projects automatically appear on the board (no redeployment needed!)

### Google Sheet Structure

Required columns:
- **Timestamp** - Auto-generated by form
- **Name** - Project name
- **Affiliation** - Campus affiliation
- **Please describe your project** - Project description
- **Please indicate the lab or student org...** - Organization/lab name
- **Status** - Manual approval column (type "Approved" to publish)

### Configuration

The app fetches from a public Google Sheets CSV endpoint. To update:

1. Open `src/App.jsx`
2. Update `SHEET_CSV_URL` constant with your sheet's public CSV URL
3. Rebuild and redeploy

## 🌐 Deployment

**Production build is ready!** See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

Quick deploy options:
- **Vercel** (recommended): `vercel`
- **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod`
- **GitHub Pages**: `npm run deploy` (after setup)
- **Traditional hosting**: Upload `dist/` folder contents
